# Bank-Loan-Analysis
Interactive Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard built with Power BI and SQL Server. Analyzes loan applications, funding, repayments, and borrower metrics with dynamic KPIs, trends, and insights for data-driven financial decision-making.

üè¶ **Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + SQL Server)**

This project is part of my Data Analyst Portfolio, highlighting an end-to-end data analysis pipeline using MS SQL Server and Power BI. The objective is to analyze loan data to evaluate lending performance, borrower behavior, and financial trends for strategic insights.

‚öôÔ∏è **Tools & Technologies**

MS SQL Server (v19.0) ‚Äì Database creation, data import, and querying

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS 19.0.20209.0) ‚Äì Query validation and optimization

Power BI (June 2023) ‚Äì DAX measures, visual design, and interactive dashboards

MS Excel (2021) ‚Äì Initial data inspection and formatting

üîç **Process Overview**

Data Loading & Cleaning ‚Äì Imported raw data into SQL Server, handled nulls, standardized formats, and created date tables.

Data Modeling ‚Äì Built relationships and developed analytical measures in Power BI.

SQL Querying ‚Äì Used joins, aggregations, and CTEs for KPI generation and validation.

Visualization ‚Äì Created dynamic dashboards and performance summaries.

üìä **Key Dashboards**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Summary Dashboard:
Tracks KPIs such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends. Includes Good vs. Bad Loan performance metrics.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Details Dashboard:
Provides a comprehensive grid of borrower profiles, loan characteristics, and repayment insights for in-depth analysis.

 **Key Concepts Applied**

SQL: Joins, CTEs, DatePart, Group By, Aggregate functions

Power BI: DAX (SUMX, CALCULATE, FILTER), time intelligence, KPI cards, and visuals

**Business Value**

The dashboard helps identify underperforming loans, track repayments, evaluate borrower risk, and uncover lending trends‚Äîempowering data-driven decisions for improved loan management and profitability.
